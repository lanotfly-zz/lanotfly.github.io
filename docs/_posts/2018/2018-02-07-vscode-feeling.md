I have used vscode for a half of year, really feel that it is a good editor for a programmer. You did not have to spend a lot of time to setup the config setting or read the guidline book or google using issues. Basically it is like the Visual Studio, that every one know it.  
In the past time, may be the emacs is best for me, because it is a famous terminal IDE. Just like the VIM. Vscode also has the terminal embaded, so vim is naturally can be used.  
In the future, maybe the web-ide is the main work tools for the programmer. No matter what tool it be, they must have the same funtions.  

To be continue...
