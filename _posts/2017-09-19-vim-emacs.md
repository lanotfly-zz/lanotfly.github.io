As a programer, I offen use linux and windows to work.
For windows, there are many IDE or editor that can be used;
but for linux, are little, exactly none.It is that change for me 
to know the vim and emacs.

Vim is kindly to the terminal, while emacs is to the IDE.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
