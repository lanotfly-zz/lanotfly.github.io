I already use github for 2 years, but gitlab is recently found. How I can say the different between them.  
Github is simple and easy, gitlab is a super set of github and has more function. Like Web-ide.

But the web-ide is not smooth when I using it. You know not precious by feeling.The simple one, I can focus my energy on it.  
Because it is simple, you can use more time on your core work.
