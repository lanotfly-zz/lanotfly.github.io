I already use github for 2 years, but gitlab is recently found. There are some differences between them.  
Github has a long history and is simple to use. Gitlab is a super set of github and with more functions. One of which like the web-ide .etc.  

But the web-ide of gitlab is not smooth enough when you compare with vscode. not precious like the desktop app, when you are used to it.
