I already use github for 2 years, but gitlab is recently found. How I can say the different between them.  
Github is simple and easy, gitlab is a super set of github and with more functions. like web-ide .etc.  

But the web-ide of gitlab is not smooth enough when I use it. You know not precious by feeling, when you are used something else.
