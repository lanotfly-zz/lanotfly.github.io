Recently, I am learning the java language. Not so fast at first, slow but every day has it's progress.  
I am a C++ programmer for many years, thought java is simpler than C++. But after some days, I knew that I am totally wrong.  
Java be birth for network, C++ for desktop. Java is totally object oriented, C++ is half half.  
If you continue to do something you like, you will get the most deep thing of it.

To be continue
