As we are child, we used to be a kind person, not to think wicked things. Because children know only what be told. After we get age, we have our own thought, make decision by our heart. That is why each other are different.  

Do what is good, not for prase from others, but also for the God. For he create the heavens and the earth, and everything in it.
We human only can change the current thing, can not create things.

To be continue...
