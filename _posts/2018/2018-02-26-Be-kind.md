As we are child, we used to be a kind person, not to think wicked things. Because children know only what has been told. After we get old age, we have our own thought, make decisions by our own heart. That is why person are different from each other.  
Each time when we have to do the decision, it is like that be in the cross street. left or right or ahead, maybe the wicked way is good for the short time, but when you take a long view point, you may find out the kind thing you do to others, may sometime come on yourself.  

To be continue...
