I have used vscode for a half of year, really feel that it is a good editor for a programmer. You didnot have to spend a lot of time to setup the config setting or read the guidline book or google using issues. Basely it is like the Visual Studio, every one who used Visual Studio must can use it.  
In the past time, may be the emacs is best for me, because it is famous of terminal IDE. The other one is the VIM.
Vscode also has the terminal embaded, so vim is naturally can be used.

To be continue...
