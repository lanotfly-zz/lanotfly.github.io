Recently I learn the jekyll on the github, so decided to make a blog for myself.
Not for something else, just by the interesting.

You can also do it by yourself.

It is amazing, so simple.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
